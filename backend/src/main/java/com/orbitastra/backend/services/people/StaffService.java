/**
 * The people a school employs — endpoints #1 to #8 of the plan in

 *
 * <p><b>The person and the job are two documents, and that is the whole design.</b> {@code Staff}
 * has no status, no department, no designation and no joining date. Every field on it is a fact
 * about a human being; everything about the employment lives on {@code EmploymentRecord}, which
 * #16 writes. Somebody created here and not yet hired is a real state, not a half-finished one.
 *
 * <p><b>This is the second half of the module's phase 1.</b> #9 and #13 built the seat; this
 * builds the person. #16 is what joins them, and five other modules are waiting on the
 * {@code staffDocsId} this hands back.
 *
 * <p><b>The gates run in the controller</b>, not here.
